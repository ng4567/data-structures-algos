    "I wrote two implementations, one using the Fisher-Yates shuffle which uses a pointer that starts at the beginning or end of an array. It will then move over one index at a time. A random number will be generated, and the number at the index of the pointer will be switched with that index. The pointer is then moved over, blocking off that section of the array. When the random numbers are generated, they have to be generated between the pointer and the length of the array - 1 so that blocked off indexes cannot be swapped. If a number that has been swapped to a later index is latter swapped as the pointer moves, that is fine, and still results in a random shuffling of the array.\n",

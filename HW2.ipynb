    "### Stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacks are an array or linked-list based data structures that adhere to a \"LIFO\" philosophy. This means that the last item added to the stack is the first item that can be removed. A stack is \"locked\" in the sense that only the last element can be removed, referred to as the top of the stack. Items are pushed onto the stack and popped off it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the time and space complexity associated with each of the stack operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`push()` - push onto top of stack\n",
    "* best/average case\n",
    "  * $O(1)$\n",
    "* worst case - when array is full and need to copy to new array\n",
    "  * $O(n)$\n",
    "`pop()` - remove (from top of stack only)\n",
    "* best/average case\n",
    "  * $O(1)$\n",
    "* worst case - only uses array indexing\n",
    "  * $O(1)$\n",
    "`peek()` - view the top element of the stack\n",
    "* best/average/worst case:\n",
    "  * $O(1)$ - always constant time for array indexing\n",
    "* `IsEmpty()` - check if stack is empty\n",
    "  * best/average/worst case:\n",
    "    * $O(1)$ - only requires if checking if a pointer is null\n",
    "* `Size()`\n",
    "  * best/average case - check size var\n",
    "    * $O(1)$\n",
    "  * worst case - requires looping through if no size var\n",
    "    * $O(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `push()` - always $O(1)$\n",
    "* `pop()` - always $O(1)$\n",
    "* space for stack - always O(n) - stack takes up n memory addresses like an array\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Washing the dishes in the sink. You would always put a new dish on top, but you would always wash the top dish on the stack.\n",
    "- Studying flashcards. You will always pick the top flash card to read, but the first card you put into the deck is on the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "Queues are similar to stacks except they are reversed. The first element to be put into the queue is the first element to be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The queue has the following operations: `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, `peek()`, `IsEmpty()`, `Size()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, they have the same time and space complexities as their stack counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lining up at the dmv. The first person in the line is the first person to be called to the counter.\n",
    "- Order fulfillment for an online store that is first come first serve. The first order submitted will be the first order fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deques\n",
    "\n",
    "A deque is a double ended queue, meaning that elements can be inserted or removed from either the front or the back. It has the following operations, all of which have $O(1)$ time complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* push (front or back)\n",
    "* pop (front or back)\n",
    "* front() - view front\n",
    "* back () - view back\n",
    "* empty() - check if empty\n",
    "* size () - check size\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Managing cargo trains. Sometimes cargo cars need to be attached or detached to a train at different stops. These cars can only be attached or detached from the beginning or the end of the train, so a deque data structure would be helpful.\n",
    "* Hospital patient management. Within an emergency room, patients should generally be seen on a first come first serve basis. However, there will be some patients that have life threatening problems that should be seen immediately. The order in which patients will be seen could be managed by a deque, with normal patients being added to the end of the deque, and patients with life threatening illnesses being added to the front."

If the middle value is greater than the target, we know the target is in the left half, so the right pointer becomes the middle - 1. Instead of updating pointer variable values, we pass the pointer values as variables to the helper function recursively. If the middle value is not greater than the target, it must be in the right half because the inputted array is sorted, so we update the pointers by moving the left pointer to the middle + 1, narrowing our search space."

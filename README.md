# Introduction
This repository contains my work for COMPSCIX 404 Data Structures and Algorithms taken at UC Berkley Extension in Summer 2024. Each of the 5 homework assignments contain algorithms to solve various data structures and algorithms problems. 

# Final Project
For my final project [link](backpropogation-from-scratch.ipynb), I built an implementation of the backpropogation algorithm from scratch, and analyzed it's time and space complexity.

Here is a YouTube video of me presenting the final project.I explain why backpropogation is needed to efficiently compute gradients of Deep Learning models, and walk through a code implementation of the algorithm. I then analyze the time and space complexity:
